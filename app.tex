\section*{Problem Statement}
The sum of first three terms of a G.P is $39/10$ and their product is $1$. Find the common ratio and the terms.

\section*{Solution}

Given the sequence of an numbers in G.P\\
Let the three terms which are in G.P be $a/r$, $a$, $ar$\\
where $r$ is the common ratio of the sequence and $a$ is the second term of the G.P\\
given the product of them is $1$ which is $a/r \cdot a \cdot ar = a^3 = 1$ so $a=1$\\
given their sum is $39/10$ which is $a/r + a + ar = 39/10$\\
\[
\frac{1}{r} + 1 + r = \frac{39}{10}
\]
\[
10r^2 + 10r + 10 = 39r
\]
\[
10r^2 - 29r + 10 = 0
\]
\[
10r^2 - 25r - 4r + 10 = 0
\]
\[
5r(2r - 5) - 2(2r - 5) = 0
\]
\[
(5r - 2)(2r - 5) = 0
\]
$r = 2/5$ or $5/2$\\
The terms of the G.P are: 
\begin{enumerate}
      \item If $r = 2/5$ , then terms are $5/2$ , $1$ , $2/5$.
      \item If $r = 5/2$ , then terms are $2/5$ , $1$ , $5/2$.
\end{enumerate}
